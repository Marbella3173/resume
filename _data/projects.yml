- project: Development of a Casual Exploratory Mobile Game Based on Navier-Stokes Simulation using a Finite Difference Approach
  role: Undergraduate Thesis
  duration: Sept, 2025 &mdash; Feb, 2026
  url: "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KFNh7ZD9dcbNn7H9B6wwEmVj7e1or-Wu/view?usp=sharing"
  description: 
    • Developed "WHISPAWAY", a mobile game designed as a relaxation medium, integrating fluid dynamics as a core gameplay mechanic. <br>
    • Implemented the Navier-Stokes equations using the Finite Difference Approximation (FDA) to create real-time, interactive fluid simulations. <br>
    • Optimized complex mathematical computations to ensure high performance and smooth frame rates on mobile devices using Unity (C#). <br>
    • Managed the full project lifecycle, from mathematical modeling and algorithm design to UI/UX implementation and user testing.
