- project: Development of a Casual Exploratory Mobile Game Based on Navier-Stokes Simulation using a Finite Difference Approach
  role: Undergraduate Thesis
  duration: May, 2025 &mdash; Jan, 2026

  description: 
    • Developed “WHISPAWAY”, a mobile game designed as a relaxation medium, integrating fluid dynamics as a core gameplay mechanic. <br>
    • Implemented the Navier-Stokes equations using the Finite Difference Approximation (FDA) to create real-time, interactive fluid simulations. <br>
    • Optimized complex mathematical computations to ensure high performance and smooth frame rates on mobile devices using Unity (C#). <br>
    • Managed the full project lifecycle, from mathematical modeling and algorithm design to UI/UX implementation and user testing.
